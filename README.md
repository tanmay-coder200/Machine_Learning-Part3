🧠 Machine Learning - Part 3: Unsupervised Learning & Deep Insights 🌌
This repository marks the transition into Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction. Here, the focus is on finding hidden structures in data where no labels exist.

🔍 What's Inside?
🧼 Clustering: Using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to discover natural groupings (Customer Segmentation).

📉 Dimensionality Reduction: Implementing PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to simplify complex datasets without losing the "soul" of the data.

🛒 Association Rule Learning: Exploring the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis.

💻 Tech Stack
Language: Python 🐍

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras

🎯 Objective
To extract actionable insights from raw, unlabeled data and optimize high-dimensional feature spaces for better computational efficiency.
